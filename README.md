# JavaScript-Super-Long-Code
An extremely long file of code filled with the fundamentals of JavaScript, organized into sections.

Instructions & Tips:

- Each section has a ⭐️ in the beginning
- To work with the code, simply copy the code section / area and paste it after the end of the huge comment.
- If you want to see the JavaScript code work in real-time, open an HTML file and a CSS file, link the JavaScript & CSS files to your HTML file, and write your JavaScript code. With the help of some HTML (and even CSS to style the webpage to your preferences), you can see the outputs and resutls in your browser page immediately. **NOTE: If you do not know how to work with HTML or CSS, I _strongly_ recommend that you do learn them because JavaScript, HTML, and CSS are all closely connected (Sass can be used alongside CSS but is definitely not manditory, unlike JS which runs pretty much all functions on a website), and without (any or good) JavaScript, your website will not function properly (or at all), and it will rather simply _look_ like a website rather than _work_ like one.**

_If you do not know HTML or CSS, you can search up on **YouTube** and **Google** to learn the basics, fundamentals, and even advanced concepts. Trust me, it's not as hard as you think it is, you're simply a YouTube or Google (mostly YouTube) search away from learning HTML and CSS. Buying courses is not necessary, but if you've watched many videos already and have done your research, if you are serius on becoming a professional web developer and a JavaScript, HTML, and CSS (even Sass) master, then you can definitely buy valuable resources that can really level up your web code. But again, I do not recommend doing that, especially not too much of it. Simply buyin one course and watching YouTube videos is enough to make you a pro, if you really put your time and full effort into it._

Good Luck working with this code (if you want to.) This is just one of my small projects that I have worked on to learn programming and web developement. You can always work on small projects that you've followed through YouTube videos or come up with your own.
